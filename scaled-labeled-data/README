        The data is a rough approximation of true C. elegans data
        because (1) the data was gathered from a schematic diagram
        of cell locations in the original source, and (2) the coordinate
        transformation method may have been nonoptimal. Thus, please do
        not use this as an authoritative source--you may have to do
        some work to clean it up.



This directory contains a scaled data in ../scaled-data with their
neurons labeled.

		coordinate only

	white-etal-celegans-neuron-position.dat
		coordinate and neuron label

	white-etal-celegans-neuron-position.sorted.csv
		sorted CSV file you can import from a spreadsheet

	white-etal-celegans-neuron-position.sorted.dat
