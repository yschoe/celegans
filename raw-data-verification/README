        The data is a rough approximation of true C. elegans data
        because (1) the data was gathered from a schematic diagram
        of cell locations in the original source, and (2) the coordinate
        transformation method may have been nonoptimal. Thus, please do
        not use this as an authoritative source--you may have to do
        some work to clean it up.



This directory contains raw screen coordinates from white:ptrslb86, and
their overlays on the actual page scans.

*.dat: 		   screen coordinates gathered using ../code/annoteppm3.tcl  .

*.png: 		   page scans (these are from white:ptrslb86: see ../README).

*.ppm: 		   PPM version of the page scans.

*.ppm-annoted.pdf: you can give the screen coordinates as command line
		   arguments to annoteppm3.tcl to visualize if you've
		   done it right. The pdf files show the results.
