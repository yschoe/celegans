plotcelegans.m : plot neuron locations.

plotcelegans.py: python version of plotcelegans.m  (this is better since it will plot in the correct aspect ratio).

annoteppm3.tcl: the main program that allows you to load a ppm file
	and click on it to get a series of (x,y) screen coordinates.

	It also allows you to give it a command line argument
	so that you can subsequently verify things like the points you
	clicked are correct.

	Just run

		annoteppm3.tcl

	for the help.

Tips:

	The program generates something like:

	12 400
	15 398
	...

	You can reap all the stuff and save that to a file, say, "data.dat".

	Then, you can use a short perl command to get these coordinates
	lined up so that it can be fed to annoteppm3.tcl:


		perl -e 'while (<STDIN>) { chop; ($a,$b)=split(/\ /); print "$a,$b,"; }' < data.dat


	This will give you something like

		12,400,15,398,....,

	Take that, and construct a annoteppm3.tcl command:


		annoteppm3.tcl 1024 768 1 image.ppm poly,12,400,15,398,...,red

	where you're using a 1024x768 ppm image "image.ppm" and you want
	to draw a polygon with the coordinates specified in color red.
