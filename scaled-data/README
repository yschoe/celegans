        The data is a rough approximation of true C. elegans data
        because (1) the data was gathered from a schematic diagram
        of cell locations in the original source, and (2) the coordinate
        transformation method may have been nonoptimal. Thus, please do
        not use this as an authoritative source--you may have to do
        some work to clean it up.



This directory contains a scaled (coordinate normalized) version of the 
raw screen coordinates from white:ptrslb86 in ../raw-data.

The coordinate normalization was done roughly as follows (which is
not by far the most accurate!):

	1. In each image, find a point that serves as a local origin.
		
		heada, headb: the end of the terminal bulb of the pharnyx
			was used as the local origin.

		taila,tailb : the anal opening was used as the local origin.

		bodya,bodyb,bodyc: the vaginal opening was used as the local
			      origin.

	2. To find the appropriate scales, measure the width of the trunk
	   at the local origins.

	3. Find relationship between the local origins in the full body
	   figure.

	4. Go run the calculations.

These are the resulting scaled data, when plotted in a single figure, will
give you an approximately worm-like layout. As you can see, bodya and bodyb
are not properly aligned.
