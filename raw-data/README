        The data is a rough approximation of true C. elegans data
        because (1) the data was gathered from a schematic diagram
        of cell locations in the original source, and (2) the coordinate
        transformation method may have been nonoptimal. Thus, please do
        not use this as an authoritative source--you may have to do
        some work to clean it up.



This directory contains raw screen coordinates from white:ptrslb86, and
the corresponding neuron labels.

In white:ptrslb86, there are 7 illustrations of C. elegans and the neurons.
The files here contain the screen coordinates (mouse-click positions
on scanned images) and their corresponding neuron labels.
See ../raw-data-verification/ for illustrations.
